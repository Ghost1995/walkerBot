 * @brief It is the implementation of a simple walker algorithm. This algorithm
 *        makes the robot move forward until it detects an obstacle. Then the
 *        robot rotates at its position to find free space. Once free space is
 *        found, the robot again moves forward until an obstacle is detected.
